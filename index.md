# About Me

On January 1st 2022, I accepted a promotion with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories to Associate Power Engineer in the Protection Systems Department within Research & Development.

I have been with SEL since April 2020 and have chosen to expand my role with SEL because during the time I have been an Electrical Engineering Intern, I have come to appreciate the quality and integrity of the company and that of the employee-owners that work here. My supervisor, Ed Atienza, has been a superb mentor and I am grateful for the time and energy he has put into creating an environment where I can learn and grow professionally within SEL. He has made it possible for me to make meaningful contributions to the company and its customers through my work. Additionally, I feel the work we do at SEL makes a positive contribution to society and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it. I am proud to work in the energy industry, advancing and implementing technology that prevents blackouts and improves power system reliability. 

I am currently attending Boise State University and will be graduating in May with my EE degree and CS minor. My background is in the auto recycling industry, where I spent many years helping people keep their cars on the road by make auto repairs more affordable and helping the environment by reducing landfill waste, saving energy, and conserving natural resources. Watching the auto industry evolve – seeing the move from fossil fuels to hybrid and electric -- has a lot to do with why I became interested in the power industry and chose to attend Boise State University in pursuit of an Electrical Engineering degree. I am drawn to being part of the effort to shift the power grid towards non-hydro renewables where I can impact quality of life for society by advancing technology that creates and manages energy in ways that increasingly are better for the environment and better at conserving earth’s natural resources. 

The experience I have gained at SEL has been beneficial to me, and I want to continue to learn more about what it takes to make the power system safer, more reliable, and more economical. My research interests are in Distributed Energy Resources and their interface to the power grid.  As advances in renewable energy including solar, wind, hydropower, and/or nuclear energy help responsibly meet the world’s growing demand for energy, I recognize a need to minimize security risk and maximize safety, reliability, and affordability. I have chosen electrical engineering and computer science because I feel like I can use my skills and interests to advance technology that helps people enjoy an ever-increasing quality of life everywhere.

I passed the fundamentals of engineering exam August 2021 and have begun working towards my PE where I will become a fully licensed professional engineer. I intend to go on and obtain my masters and have chosen a path making lifelong learning my life’s pursuit and eventually becoming a distinguished engineer and an expert in my field. I wish to continue developing skills to help others be better engineers and create new solutions to new problems that haven’t even been thought about yet.
