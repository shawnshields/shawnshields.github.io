# About Me

I work in energy, advancing and implementing technology that prevents blackouts and improves power system reliability. I am interested in advancing non-hydro-renewable energy  to responsibly meet the world’s growing demand for energy. I am currently with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories in R&D in the Distribution Controls and Sensors. I am proud to work for SEL because I feel like the attitudes and mission are aligned neatly with my own. I intend to continue expanding my understanding of electrical engineering in my career as an electrical engineer. I passed the the fundamentals of engineering exam August 2021 and have begun working towards my PE. I intend to go on and obtain my masters and eventually I want to become a fully licensed professional engineer. I want to make lifelong learning my life’s pursuit ---eventually becoming a distinguished engineer and an expert in my field. I hope to have published papers and patents. I wish to use my future skills to help others be better engineers and create new solutions to new problems that haven’t even been thought about yet.

I have worked in the automobile recycling industry for most of my professional life. After twenty-five years of career engagement, reaching a mid-level management position with a major auto recycling and wholesale parts distribution business, I left to pursue a BS electrical engineering. The recycling industry that I left is a great industry. It provides many benefits to society. It is green, it helps people repair cars cost effectively, it provides competition to the large automakers and helps hold prices down. My new journey is in pursuit of a desire to innovate and create new solutions that advance society. I am interested in Distributed Energy Resources and their interface to the power grid.  As advances in renewable energy including solar, wind, hydropower, and/or nuclear energy help responsibly meet the world’s growing demand for energy, I recongnize a need to minimize security risk and maximize safety, reliability, and affordability. I have chosen electrical engineering and computer science because I feel like I can use my skills and interests to advance technology that helps people enjoy an ever-increasing quality of life everywhere.
